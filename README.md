> Miles Morales, a teen from Brooklyn, gains spider powers and is mentored by 'Peter Parker'. When Peter leaves, Miles faces The Underground, led by his friend Phin (The Tinkerer), who seeks revenge against Roxxon. Roxxon’s dangerous Nuform energy threatens Harlem, and Miles tries to stop Phin’s destructive plan. In a dramatic climax, he absorbs the reactor’s explosion, saving the city but nearly dying. Harlem accepts him as their Spider-Man, and Peter trusts him to protect New York.
